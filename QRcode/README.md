# What I learned

To center the content vertically (it was not easy rigth away) and horizontally I tried:

- class 'row justify-content-center' and "vh-100" from Bootstrap

+ custom css: 
  - outer block:  position: relative;
  - inner block: display: inline-block; position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; margin: auto 0;
